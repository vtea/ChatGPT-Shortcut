# Community Prompts

The community prompt section will showcase custom prompts shared and uploaded by users. You can share prompts on a public page and also view prompts shared by others for inspiration.

## Sorting and Voting

The community prompt page offers options for sorting by publication time, upvotes/downvotes, and keyword search. You are free to filter community prompts according to your preferences.

Upvotes/downvotes will determine the prompts included on the main page. Currently, only logged-in users can vote, and only the most recent vote for the same prompt will be recorded.

## Private Prompts

If you desire to keep your prompts private, you can choose whether or not to share them with the community when submitting or updating your prompts.
